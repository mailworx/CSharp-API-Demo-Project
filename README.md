# CSharp-API-Demo-Project
Sample implementation for consuming mailworx API

This demo project shows how to consume the mailworx SOAP API with C#.
There are several methods available and implemented for importing new subscribers, reading the available subscriber metadata, adding them to a certain subscriber group (profile), reading or updating campaigns etc.
Further descriptions of the mailworx api can be found here: http://www.mailworx.info/api (Documentation in German).

Have fun with this code.

the mailworx Developer Team.
